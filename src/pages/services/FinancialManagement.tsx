                Reserve Planning That Prevents Special Assessments
              </h2>
            </div>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Nothing damages community trust like an unexpected special assessment. Proper reserve planning is the single most important financial practice an association can adopt, and it is an area where many communities fall short. Stellar Property Group takes reserve planning seriously because we have seen firsthand the consequences when associations are caught unprepared for major capital expenses.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              We coordinate professional reserve studies that inventory every major component of your property, estimate useful life and replacement costs, and establish a funding plan that builds your reserves steadily over time. Our goal is to help your association achieve at least 70% reserve funding, which the Community Associations Institute considers the threshold for a well-funded reserve.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
              Beyond the reserve study itself, we integrate reserve planning into your annual budget process, recommend investment strategies for reserve funds, and provide regular updates on reserve adequacy as market conditions and project timelines evolve. When capital projects arise, we manage the bidding and construction process to ensure reserve dollars are spent wisely and the work meets the highest quality standards.
